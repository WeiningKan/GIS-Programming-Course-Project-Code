### Background
PM2.5 describes the small particles of concern; they are "fine particles" (such as those found in smoke and haze), which are 2.5 micrometers in diameter or less. Ozone is a very reactive gas made of three atomsof oxygen and is the main component of urban smog. Unlike the oxygen we breathe, ozone can be harmful at high levels.  

Moreover, these two pollutants both harm human health. In recent years, ozone and PM pollution often occur at the same time, and these two pollutants sometimes show a positive correlation in summertime. Some studies have pointed out that high PM2.5 concentrations suppresses solar radiation and Ozone production in cold season.

### Study Area
For this project, my study area focused on the state of Florida.

- Temporal Scope: Over the six years, from 2015 to 2020, I gathered comprehensive data on PM2.5 (Particulate Matter) and Ozone.

- Spatial Scope: The study spans across various cities within the state, allowing for a detailed examination of air quality variations at both the state and city levels.
